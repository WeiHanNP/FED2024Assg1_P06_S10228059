            <h2>
                early life
            </h2>
            <p>Ashin was born in Beitou District, Taiwan into a family of four, consisting of his parents, himself, and a younger brother. His family owned a record store, which inspired his passion for music. Ashin's childhood ambition was to become a singer, but his vocal range was too narrow. He claims his bandmates selected him to be Mayday's singer as he was the worst instrumentalist out of all of them. Ashin can play both guitar and drums.</p>
            <p>Ashinâ€™s passion for music began in his teenage years when he discovered rock and pop music. He was particularly drawn to Western bands like The Beatles and Oasis, as well as Japanese rock influences.
              He taught himself to sing and developed his unique voice by experimenting with different musical styles.
              During high school, he formed a band with friends, which later evolved into what is now Mayday.</p>
