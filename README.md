####Index Page
* The Blue MayDay header uses an eventlistener to make it disappear when the user scrolls down to the slideshows.
* Slideshows using the setTimeout, it will the picture every 4seconds
* Blurred background using the eventlistener mouseover, user hover over the area the background is automatically blurred. when user of the area the background will change back to normal.

#### Album Page
There is too much information to be displayed on one page. To address this, I created an interactive album that allows users to select the album they are interested in. When a user clicks on an album image, the onclick event built into HTML calls the changeAlbum function. This function first disables all information and then gets the ID from the HTML.
